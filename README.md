# STA496H1 – Readings in Statistics: History of Statistics Website

This website showcases the work of **Kiki He**, a senior undergraduate student at the **University of Toronto**, double majoring in **Mathematics and Statistics**. It was created as part of **STA496H1: Readings in Statistics**, an independent study course supervised by **[Professor Rohan Alexander](https://rohanalexander.com/index.html)** in the **Department of Statistical Sciences**.

## About the Course

STA496H1 is a research-based course that allows students to explore a specialized topic in statistics under faculty supervision. Admission is limited and subject to departmental approval. For this project, the chosen topic is the **history of statistics**.

The course explores how key statistical ideas and methods—such as probability, regression, causal inference, and data visualization—emerged and evolved. It also examines the broader historical, philosophical, and social context in which these tools were developed, including their ties to both scientific progress and controversial movements such as eugenics.
